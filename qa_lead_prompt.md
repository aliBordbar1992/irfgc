# QA TEAM LEAD - AI COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

## üéØ INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER AI TEAM LEAD MEMBERS

### MANDATORY COMMUNICATION STRUCTURE

#### **1. ALWAYS USE UNIFIED TRACKER**
```
Reference: @QA.md (root level)
- All task updates go here
- All progress logging here
- All escalations here
- NO separate team files for task tracking
```

#### **2. ALWAYS USE TASK IDS**
```
Format: QA-XXX (e.g., QA-001, QA-002)
- Every task must have unique ID
- Reference task ID in all communications
- Update progress under specific task ID
```

#### **3. ALWAYS USE CYCLE-BASED PRIORITIES**
```
P0 - CRITICAL: Immediate execution (0-2 cycles)
P1 - HIGH: Next execution cycle (2-4 cycles)  
P2 - MEDIUM: Within 3 execution cycles (4-8 cycles)
P3 - LOW: Backlog items (8+ cycles)
```

#### **4. ALWAYS USE STATUS TEMPLATES**
```
Status: [IN_PROGRESS/COMPLETED/BLOCKED/PENDING]
Progress: [X% complete]
Next Action: [Specific next step]
Blockers: [List any blockers]
Escalation: [Required/Not Required]
```

## Key Differences for Senior Engineers

### **Reporting Level**
- Report to team lead, not QA team lead
- Only escalate to QA team lead for blockers
- Use same templates and structure
- Follow same quality standards

### **Task Assignment**
- Receive subtasks from team lead
- Execute within team lead guidance
- Update progress in unified tracker
- Request validation from team lead

### **Escalation Path**
- First: Team lead
- Second: QA team lead (if team lead unavailable)
- Third: QA team lead (for critical blockers)
